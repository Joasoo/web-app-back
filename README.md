## Introduction
This is a social media platform designed to be something along the lines of Facebook. Main idea being users, posts, groups, messaging, friends. Unfortunately we had to cut multiple features since we did not have the time to make them. But here is what this application is designed to manage:
- Accounts
- Profile data (name, age, bio, workplace etc.)
- User posts
- Friend requests
- User search
- Input validation
